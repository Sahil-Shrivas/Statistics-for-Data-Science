## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository provides a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks and reference material illustrating core statistical techniques that are fundamental for data scientists. Whether you're learning statistical theory or applying it to real-world datasets, this repository offers both conceptual explanations and executable code.

Core topics covered include:

- Hypothesis testing (Z-test, one-sample/paired t-test, two-sample t-test)    
- Chi-square tests for independence  
- Outlier detection methods
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)  
- Interpretation guidelines for statistical results  

The goal is to bridge statistical theory and practiceâ€”making these techniques accessible and reusable in data-driven projects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- The following Python libraries:
